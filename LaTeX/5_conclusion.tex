\section{Conclusion}

ADT and deep learning may not be foreign continents to each other \ citep {lebart1997}. This contribution by crossing statistical approach and neural network allowed us to identify key passages and perhaps reasons that could feed our textual treatments. If the observables that presided over the detection of key passages by the ADT (the lexical specificities) are known and tested, the zones of activation of the deep learning seem to raise new linguistic observables. Recall that the linguistic matter and the topology of the passages can not return to chance: the zones of activations make it possible to obtain recognition rates of more than 90 \% on the French political speech and 85 \% on the corpus of the LASLA ; either rates equivalent to or higher than the rates obtained by the statistical calculation of the key passages. It remains to improve the model and to understand all the mathematical and linguistic outcomes. The first improvement that we now propose to implement is the injection of morphosyntactic information into the network in order to test ever more complex linguistic patterns.
